===================== FIXES =====================
⦿ None so far

===================== FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION =====================
6/6/25
⦿ Include more personal information
    ⦿ Page first shocases my photo, basic bio, hobbies, interest, etc.
    ⦿ Goes into Masters infromation, bachelors, then high school

6/7/25
⦿ Include case competition projects
    ⦿ Add on...


================== Implemented (Starting 6/7) ==================
Okay, I want to do a major change to the home section, 

⦿ The top portion from the top to bottom boundary of the area around the navigation bar should be Light Blue: Hex #ADD8E6 | RGB 173,216,230


⦿ Page first shocases my photo (left) and bio (right) where the photo is under images/Photo.jpg

Recent Binghamton University '25 graduate with an MS (AI Track) and BS in Computer Science with ambitions towards fields within artificial intelligence, machine learning, software engineering, and tech consulting. I'm eager to showcase my academic and project experience from these fields in crafting innovative solutions for practical and pertinent challenges. 


⦿ After scrolling down, it takes you to the Skillset section where I have an image of my university images/Bing.jpg that has the same fade in transition where the image takes up 70 percent (on the left side) where the text on the right side is as follows with an arrow that takes the user to the skills page underneath the text (same function as navigation bar)

Throughout highschool and college, I've honed in my knowledge of computer science, expertise in coding, understanding of core software engineering principle, pragmatic application of machine learning and artificial intelligence in addition to advancing smart health outcomes within a research purview. Nearing 8 years of experience within computer science, I've become adept in a vast variety of programming languages such as Python, C and Java to name a few, forever shifting the way I interacted and viewed the world.


⦿ After scrolling down, it takes you to the Experience sections where I have an image within images/Gesture.png that has the same fade in transition and that should be on the left side taking 70% where the text on the right side is as follows with an arrow that takes the user to the projects page underneath the text (same function as navigation bar)

On my computer science voyage, my most impactful mission has been co-authoring a scientific survey culminating and analyzing the advancements of gesture recognition technology in recent years in different contexts like gesture classification, sequence modeling and generative motion synthesis with current research contributions intended to be submitted to the CHI 2025 Yokohama, Japan ACM conference. This only captures the top of the iceberg with my expertise defined by many more projects

⦿ Then at the bottom, it has an arrow that redirects to the contacts page that says "Go to Contact Links"
